# Guide to being a new Bug Hunter!

Hello and welcome to the **Bug Huntersâ„¢**. Here's a guide for being a bug hunter and hopefully making it easier for you to be able to help Discord improve *by finding those peaky bugs*

There's a few things we will go through with the most improtant thing being bugs.

## Bugs

As to no ones expectations Bugs are the main thing that you will be dealing with... and I'm not talking about the small creepy crawly things, I'm talking about minor problems or "glitches" within Discord that aren't meant to happen. These can range from the most simplest of things causing issues for only a few users, to major issues effecting every use.
